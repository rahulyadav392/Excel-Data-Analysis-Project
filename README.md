# Excel Data Analysis Project
 
## Scope of the Project

This project talks about the link between essential skills and various roles in the data science domain. 

### Key Questions Explored

-Does a greater number of skills correlate with higher compensation?

-How do salaries for data-related roles vary by region?

-What are the most in-demand skills among data professionals?

-What is the average salary associated with the top 10 skills in the field?

### Excel Skills Used
The following Excel skills were utilized for analysis:

- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Power Query
- Power Pivot


The dataset used in this project is real life 'Data Science' jobs posted on various job portals in 2023. This dataset contains:

- Job Location
- Skills
- Salary
- Job Title

## :one: Does a greater number of skills correlate with higher compensation?

### SKILLS Used: PowerQuery

**Extract**

- I first used Power Query to extract the original data (data_salary_all.xlsx) and create two queries:
    - First one with all the data jobs information.
    - The second listing the skills for each job ID.

 **Transform**
 
   Then, I transformed each query by changing column types, removing unnecessary columns, cleaning text to eliminate specific words, and trimming excess whitespace.

   :white_circle: salary_all_skills

   ![salary_all_skills](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79e7e45c-fd60-441a-a679-b53f8a5d1e8d)

### Load

- Finally, I loaded both transformed queries into the workbook, setting the foundation for my subsequent analysis.

### üìä Analysis

 üí° Insights
 
 - There exists a positive correlation between the number of skills listed in job postings and the corresponding median salary‚Äîmost notably in roles such as **Senior Data Engineer** and **Data Scientist**. This suggests that positions requiring a broader skill set tend to offer higher compensation.
     
 - Roles that typically require fewer technical skills‚Äîsuch as **Business Analyst**‚Äîtend to be associated with lower median salaries. This trend indicates that positions demanding more specialized or diverse skill sets are generally valued higher in the job market.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How do salaries for data-related roles vary by region?

### SKILLS Used: PivotTables, DAX & Slicers 

### :white_circle: PivotTable 

- A PivotTable was created using the integrated **Data Model** built with **Power Pivot**, enabling advanced data analysis through relationships across multiple tables and DAX-based calculations.
- I moved the job_title_short to the rows area and median_salary into the values area.
- Then I added new measure to calculate the median salary for United States jobs.

```
=CALCULATE(
[Median Salary],
data_all[job_country]="United States")
```

### :white_circle: DAX

 - To Calculate Median Salary 
   
   ```
    =MEDIAN(data_all[salary_year_avg])
   ```
 - To Calculate Median Salary for countries other than USA
   
   ```
    =CALCULATE([Median Salary], data_all[job_country]<>"United Stated")
   ```
### :white_circle: Slicers 

Slicers were implemented to enable dynamic comparison between the **median salary of a selected country** and that of the **United States**. This interactive functionality allows users to explore salary differentials across regions in a flexible and user-driven manner.

### üìä Analysis

üí° Insights

Job roles like Senior Data Engineer and Data Scientist command higher median salaries both in the US and internationally, showcasing the global demand for high-level data expertise.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ How do salaries for data-related roles vary by region?

### SKILLS Used: Power Pivot

:white_circle: **Power Pivot**

- I created a data model by integrating the **data_all** and **salary_all_skills** tables into one model.

  **Data Model**

- I created a relationship between my two tables using the job_id column.

 **Power Pivot Menu**

 Power Pivot Menu was used to to refine data and makes it easier to create measures.

 ### üìä Analysis

üí° Insights

- **SQL** and **Python** are the top skills required in data domain at 57% and 53%
- **Azure** and **AWS** also show significant presence, underlying the industry's shift towards cloud services and big data technologies.
